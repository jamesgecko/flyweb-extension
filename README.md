# ![logo](icon.png) FlyWeb extension 

This is a super simple, incomplete attempt to implement the [FlyWeb](https://flyweb.github.io/)
API specification as a WebExtension browser addon.

It requires a companion [Node server](https://github.com/jamesgecko/flyweb-server)
running on your local machine to function. It's probably insecure as all get out.

Right now it mostly just discovers FlyWeb MDNS services. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
